# Explosive Enhancement

### Enhancing explosions since 2023.

Explosive Enhancement is a small mod which makes the Minecraft explosion animation look nicer. It adds new particles, has a small config, and allows you to enable/disable the default explosion effect.

**Please note:** This mod requires Fabric API. If you wish to change the config, you will need Mod Menu.
